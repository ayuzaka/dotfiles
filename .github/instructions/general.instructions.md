- Things to do before you finish
- Check format, lint, and types
- Start small and grow incrementally
- Avoid excessive abstraction
- Types over code
- Adapt your approach to complexity
- Functions first (classes only when necessary)
- Utilizing new patterns that do not change
- Flatten conditionals with early returns
- Direct use of external libraries, except for React, is prohibited. Be sure to create an abstraction layer and use them from there.
- Avoid adding code comments unless necessary.
