* Prioritize unit tests of pure functions
* Write tests according to the 3A pattern
* Clearly state the purpose of the test case name, such as what you want to test
* Assert first: work backwards from the expected result
* Start small and grow incrementally
* Test case names are in Japanese
* When writing front-end tests, write them based on the ideas of Kent C. Dodds' Testing Trophy.
* When using Vitest, use test instead of it
